# Recipe Builder using nodes and edges

## How to start the project

- in the main folder (recipe-builder) run `npm install`
- `cd client && npm install`
- `cd ..`
- `cd server && npm install`
- `cd .. && npm run start` - this will start the app with hot reload both on the front end and backend

## The app has the following features

- get nodes and edges from the database
- create new node

## What I wish I could do if I had more time

- a shared types package that will server both the backend and the frontend enhance DRY code
- validation and tests (remove this if I manage to do it and update this file referencing the tests and validation)
- mock the database services to avoid interaction with the real database
- a favicon icon for the Zero One Recipe Builder App
